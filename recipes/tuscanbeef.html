    <h1>Tuscan Black Pepper Beef</h1>
    <img src="../images/tuscanbeef.webp">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The story goes that terracotta tile workers in Impruneta, Tuscany, would place this stew into
         clay pots and cook it in their still-hot kilns overnight where it would be ready in the morning.
        They used a lot of pepper because the meat was not always top quality. The amount of pepper is up
         to you--I used a ridiculous amount, but even so it wasn't overpowering.</p>
         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>6 beef short ribs (8 to 10 oz. each)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>8 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed</li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon tomato paste </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons whole black peppercorns, freshly crushed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>3 sage leaves</li>
            <li>3 small sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 cups red wine, preferably Chianti</li>
            <li>salt to taste, to adjust sauce</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Place meat in a large mixing bowl</li>
            <li>Sprinkle all sides generously with 1 tablespoon kosher salt. </li>
            <li>Place chopped garlic and a pinch of salt in a mortar and mash with pestle until pastelike</li>
            <li>Add tomato paste; mash until blended</li>
         </ol>
